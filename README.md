- 👋 Bernhard here, Supporting IT-Infrastructure since setting up my parents' printer back in 1999
- 👀 I’m interested in training my understanding of coding, and algorithms for artificial intelligence (machine learning / deep learning)
- 🌱 Randomly playing around among others with Python, GIT-Logic, and Database-Magic
- 💞️ Interests: learning new languages (Japanese/Korean/Chinese), assembling way too many books and procrastinating most of the time with logic games.
