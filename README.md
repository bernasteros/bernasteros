- 👋 I am Bernhard, working as a Lab-Tech Support Engineer at a big pharmaceutical company
- 👀 I’m interested in training my understanding of coding, and algorithms for artificial intelligence (machine learning / deep learning)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and playing around with GIT, and git-hub
- 💞️ Interests: learning new languages (Japanese/Korean/Chinese), assembling way too many books and procrastinating most of the time with logic games (Shenzhen IO) and Udemy-Courses.
